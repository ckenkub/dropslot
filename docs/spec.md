## Data Architecture

### Database Design
The system uses a relational database with the following key entities:
- Users (with roles and permissions)
- Stores and Branches (multi-tenant architecture)
- Products (catalog management)
- Drops and Slots (time-boxed reservations)
- Reservations and Waitlist (booking management)
- Payments (financial transactions)
- Notifications (communication system)
- Webhooks (external integrations)
- Audit Logs (compliance and tracking)

### Key Relationships
- Stores contain multiple branches and products
- Products have multiple drops with time slots
- Users can make reservations or join waitlists
- Reservations can have associated payments
- Webhook endpoints emit events for external systems

## Integration Points

### External Services
- Payment processors (Stripe/Omise)
- Email services (SendGrid)
- SMS services (Twilio)
- Communication platforms (LINE, Slack)
- Calendar systems (Google, Apple)

### Webhook System
- Configurable webhook endpoints per store
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Signature validation for security

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
- Rancher Desktop for Kubernetes development
- Skaffold for continuous development
- Local PostgreSQL with persistent volumes
- PlantUML server for diagram generation

### Deployment Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Docker image building with Jib
- Kubernetes manifests for production deployment
- Rolling update strategy for zero-downtime deployments
